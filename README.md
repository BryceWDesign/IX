# 🧠 IX — The Language of AI Agents  
> “I Experience” — A lightweight, human-readable language built for AI bot design, autonomy, and conversation.

## ✨ What is IX?

IX is a new programming language purpose-built for defining, building, and deploying AI-powered bots and agents.

It is to AI agents what HTML was to the web — readable, learnable, and extendable by anyone.  
Where traditional languages are general-purpose, IX is focused:  
designing thought flows, conversational behaviors, memory, and agent logic.

> IX = “I Experience” → Born from UX/UI, evolved for AI.

## 🚀 Why IX?

- 🧩 Modular by design — build AI agents like Lego blocks.
- 💬 Native support for thought patterns, conversation trees, memory triggers.
- 🪄 Easy for beginners — readable like markup, powerful like code.
- 🤖 Integrates with LLMs, APIs, actions, and sensors.
- 📦 Lightweight — no bloated dependencies.
- 🔧 Can be parsed by Python, Node.js, Rust, or your own interpreter.

## 📦 Quick Preview

```ix
agent "ShopAssistant" {
  personality: "Friendly"
  memory: short_term
  on_input "Find shoes" {
    respond "Sure! What style are you looking for?"
    trigger action: search_inventory(category="shoes")
  }
}

🛠 Use Cases
Chatbots & assistants (web, mobile, embedded)

Autonomous NPCs for games

Voice assistants

Workflow and decision agents

AI "plugins" for other apps

Agent simulators and multi-agent systems

🔧 Project Status
🧪 Experimental — IX is in early design/testing phase.
Contributions, testing, and design discussions are welcome.

Planned milestones:

✅ Language design specification (WIP)

⏳ Reference parser/interpreter (Python)

⏳ Agent execution runtime

⏳ Web sandbox for testing agents

⏳ VS Code extension for IX

🌐 Goals
Democratize AI agent development

Give creators and thinkers a tool to define agent logic without deep code

Become the new foundation layer for agent-centric AI systems
