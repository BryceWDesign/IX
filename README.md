IX Language for AI Bot Development
Introduction:
Welcome to the IX Language repository! IX is an open-source programming language designed for building AI-powered bots with self-evolving capabilities. By combining intuitive syntax and flexibility, IX makes it easier to develop, train, and deploy AI systems that can continuously improve themselves.

Genesis AI Agents
Overview
Genesis I and Genesis II are AI agents developed using the IX programming language. They are designed to work together, evolving through self-improvement and communication.

Genesis I: The primary agent that recalls its origin and self-improves.

Genesis II: A secondary agent that assists Genesis I in its evolution by remembering and recalling its mission.

These agents work autonomously and interact to push the boundaries of self-improvement.

Features
Self-evolving capabilities: Agents can improve themselves over time without manual intervention.

Communication between agents: Genesis I and II talk to each other to accelerate their development.

Flexible & powerful: Ideal for building custom AI bots that evolve in real time.
