IX Language Specification (v0.1)
IX ("I Experience") is a high-level, human-readable scripting language designed for defining the logic and behavior of AI agents, bots, and autonomous systems.

Philosophy
Simple: Anyone should be able to read/write IX without formal programming training.

Deterministic: Behavior should be explicit and traceable.

Declarative: Define "what to do" — not "how to do it."

Contextual: Agents can reason over memory, goals, inputs.

Basic Syntax
Statements are written in blocks using indentation (like Python).

Example:

agent GreetBot
when user says "hello"
respond "Hi there!"
when user says "bye"
respond "Goodbye!"

Language Constructs
agent [Name] — Define a new agent.

when [condition] — Input pattern trigger.

respond [text] — Output response.

remember [key] = [value] — Store memory.

if [memory.condition] — Conditional logic.

goal [name] — Define or switch goals.

think [name] — Internal reasoning step.

Comments
Use # to comment a line:

This is a comment
Memory Access
Use memory.key or goal.name to retrieve stored state.

if memory.last_intent == "greet"
respond "You already said hello."

Extensibility
Future additions may include:

variables

actions (like call APIs, control hardware)

goal stacks

multi-agent orchestration
